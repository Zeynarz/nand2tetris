Goal: Develop an application of choice using the Jack programming language (d)

(d) means Done

Own thoughts
--------------
Initially I wanted to develop a pong game because the first programming video that I remembered
following was a video about coding a Pong game in JS . I was 10 when I followed it and I don't think that 
I understood a thing from the video. I was exactly copying what the guy was typing (I copied it in
notepad) and when I opened the .html file to see the Pong game running, I was filled with joy.
Although I copied everything, it still felt awesome because I saw and witnessed the power of programming

But it seems like nand2tetris already showed a lot of examples of Pong games programmed using Jack.
So instead I will make a platformer game because the same guy that made the JS Pong game video also
made a video on coding a platformer.
