Given:
-All the chips build in project 1 and 2
-Data Flip Flop

Goal: Build the following chips:
      -Bit(d) -Register(d) -RAM8(d) -RAM64(d)
      -RAM512(d) -RAM4K(d) -RAM16K(d) -PC

(d) means done

Implementation tips
--------------------
RAM8:
-Feed the in value to all the registers simultaneuously
-Use multiplexers/demultiplexers to get the right register

RAM64 and more:
-stack 8 RAM8s to make RAM64
-stack 8 RAM64s to make RAM512
-etc etc

Think about RAM's address input as consisting of two fields;
-One field can be used to select a RAM-part
-The other firled can be used to select a register within that RAM-part
-Use Mux/Demux

Program Counter:
-Can be built from a register,an incrementor,and some logic gates
