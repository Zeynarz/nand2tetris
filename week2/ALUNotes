ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
----------------------------
Von Neumman wrote a paper including a diagram that described how a general purpose computer can be built (Von Neumman Architecture)
In the Von Neumman Architecture, the CPU contained an ALU and a control unit

   function/control bits
            |

Input1 ->   A
            L   ->  output
Input2 ->   U

function could be arithmetic operations(add,multiply,subtract) 
or logical operations (And,Or,Xor)

If dont want to implement something in the hardware level/ALU,for example multiplication
can always implement it in the software level

The Hack ALU
--------------
16bit input and output 
6 one bit inputs to determine what function to use (For example: 011111 = x+1;  001110 = x-1;)

The 6 one bit inputs actually have meaning,they're kind of like flags
zx :if zx then x=0
nx :if nx then x=!x
zy :if zy then y=0
ny :if ny then y=!y
f  :if f then x+y else x&y
no :out = !out
out:out(x,y)

(These happen one after another,so if zx and nx is set,x will be 16bit 1s)

There are also 2 output bits that kind of act like flags
zr: if out == 0, then zr = 1,else zr = 0
ng: if out is negative,ng = 1, else ng=0
