Goal: Develop a syntax analyser for the Jack Language
    ArrayTest: Main.xml MainT.xml(d)
    ExpressionLessSquare: Main.xml MainT.xml(d) Square.xml SquareT.xml(d) SquareGame.xml 
                          SquareGameT.xml(d)
    Square: Main.xml MainT.xml(d) Square.xml SquareT.xml(d) SquareGame.xml SquareGameT.xml(d)

(d) means done


There is a tool named TextComparer in nand2tetris/tools used to compare text files
String constants outputed in the xml file dont have double quotes

So "Hello World" in the .xml file will be 
<stringConstant> Hello World </stringConstant>

<,>,", and & are outputted as &lt;  &gt;  &quot;  and &amp;
< = &lt; > = &gt;
" = &quot; & = &amp;


Implementation tips
--------------------
-Build a basic CompilationEngine first that handles everything except expressions, then only
 build the complete version of the CompilationEngine

To test the first version of the CompilationEngine,test using the ExpressionLessSquare jack programs 
which doesnt contain any expressions.

Then to test the complete verysion of the CompilationEngine, use the Square jack programs.

There is no compileSubroutineCall method, rather the subroutine call logic is handled in 
compileTerm
