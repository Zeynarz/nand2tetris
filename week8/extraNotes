The big picture: program compilation and translation
-------------------------------------------------------
myProg directory contains Foo.jack and Bar.jack

Compiler compiles the whole myProg directory

now myProg directory contains Foo.vm and Bar.vm

VM Translator translates the whole myProg directory

now myProg directory only have one assembly file which is myProg.asm

Booting
--------
There are a few conventions/rules

One file in any VM program directory is expected to be named Main.vm and one VM function in 
Main.vm is expected to be named main

When the VM implementation starts running,or is reset, it starts by calling the argument-less OS function
Sys.init

Sys.init then calls Main.main and enters an infinite loop

Bootstrap code:
The first two instructions that the computer should execute is

SP = 256
call Sys.init (in assembly)

Standard mapping of Hack
-------------------------
address 0-15 : pointers and registers
address 16-255 : static variables
address 256-2047 : stack
address 2048-16383: heap
address 16384-24576: memory mapped I/O
