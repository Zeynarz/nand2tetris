## Nand2Tetris(Building a Modern Computer from First Principles)
(Notes for nand2tetris)   
coursera : https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer/   
The instructors of nand2tetris (Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken) specifically requested on their page to not post solutions publicly, so I wont upload my solutions to this github repo    

Nand2tetris is the best applied computer science course that I have ever taken. Before nand2tetris, I didn't even know what a demultiplexer was, how processors work, how compilers generate low level code etc, nand2tetris has taught me all these things, and even gave me the knowledge needed to build myself, a processor, RAM, a computer, an assembler, a vm translator, a compiler, and a standard OS library. It has been very fun taking this course and doing the projects, to anyone who reads this, I encourage you to take this course. I am very glad that I chose to take this course, a few months ago.  

Thank you to Noam Nisan, Shimon Schocken, and everyone else that has helped made this course, I am eternally grateful to you all, and god bless you all.
