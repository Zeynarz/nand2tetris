Goal: Hack Assembler (d)

(d) means done

-Should translate Hack assembly to Hack binary code
test.asm -> assembler -> test.hack
(assembler assumes that the .asm file is error free)

Need:
-Parser
-Code (function that translates each field to corresponding binary value)
-Symbol table
-Main

(The instructors recommend us to develop an assembler that can't deal with symbols first,then when the 
assembler works fine,implement symbols in the assembler)
