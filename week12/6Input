THE KEYBOARD CLASS
--------------------
The Keyboard Class contais the subroutines:
-keyPressed     -readLine
-readChar       -readInt


Remember that there is a keyboard memory map, which is a 16-bit word at address 24576.
Whenever a key is pressed on the keyboard, the unicode / ascii code of the key is stored in the
keyboard register / memory map. If no key is pressed,the keyboard register is est to 0.

The unicode of each key: charSet.png

For example, when you press "k" on the keyboard, as long as your finger is down on the "k" key,
RAM[24576] = 0000000001001011 (75). Once you lift your finger off, and nothing is touching the 
keyboard, RAM[24576] = 0000000000000000 (0)

In the Hack computer, if you press a key, and then without lifting your finger you use another finger
to press another key, RAM[24576] will contain the ASCII code of the second key.

For example, if you press "a", and then you keep pressing "a", and use another finger to press "b",
RAM[24576] will be the ASCII code of "b".

(If multiple keys are being pressed,what will be in RAM[24576]? Well as humans it's pretty much impossible
to press two keys at the exact same millisecond,so it would prob depend on the human and which key he/she
presses first. RAM[24576] will contain the code of the key that is pressed last.

If they are actually pressed at the exact same millisecond, it prob depends on which key's signal reaches 
the computer faster, whoever is slower will be in RAM[24576].)

Now let's start to discuss about the subroutines of the Keyboard Class.


Implementation of keyPressed()
==================================================================================================
keyPressed returns the IMMEDIATE currently pressed code, if no key is pressed, 0 is returned.
It essentially just returns the value of the keyboard memory map of that time.

keyPressed():
    if a keyboard key is pressed:
        returns the key's scan code

    else
        return 0


This is the most primitive input function of the Jack OS. 
This function is like a realtime listener, when you invoke / call it,what you get is what is 
currently being pressed on the keyboard in this very instant of time.


Implementation of readChar()
===================================================================================================
Instead of returning the immediate currently pressed code like keyPressed(), readChar() actually 
waits for the user input, then returns the char read. The char read will be echoed to the screen.

keyPressed() doesn't wait for anything, and just returns the value of the keyboard memory map.
readChar() waits until a key is pressed and RELEASED, then returns the char read.

readChar():
    display the cursor

    // waits until a key is pressed
    while (keyPressed() == 0):
        do nothing

    c = code of the currently pressed key

    // waits until key is released
    while (keyPressed() != 0):
        do nothing

    display c at the current cursor location
    advance the cursor


(If a key is already pressed while readChar() is called, it just needs to wait for the key to be released)

If you press a key, and without letting go of the key you press another key, and then you release both
keys (when RAM[24576] is equal to 0), the first key will probably be returned. This is because the first 
key is captured in the "c" variable.


If the user presses a key and then releases it insanely quickly, will it be possible that when the key is
pressed, keyPressed() != 0, and the loop is broken, but when you try to capture the key in "c", the key is
already released, and c = 0.


Implementation of readString()
===================================================================================================
Keep reading chars until a newLine is read, then the text will be echoed to the screen.

readLine():
    str = empty string

    repeat:
        // All the waiting of user input is already handled in readChar()
        c = readChar()
        
        if (c == newLine):
            display newLine // can be done and handled using Output.println()
            return str
        
        elif (c == backSpace):
            remove the last character from str
            do Output.backspace()

        else:
            str = str.append(c)


Implementation notes
===================================================================================================
keyPressed() can be very easily implemented using Memory.peek()

For readChar and readLine, simply implement the algorithm mentioned above

For readInt, just read characters (digits) and build the integer value
